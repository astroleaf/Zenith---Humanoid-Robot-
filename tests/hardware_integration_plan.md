# Hardware Integration Testing Plan

## Objectives
- Validate sensor readouts are accurate and timely.
- Confirm motor driver commands produce expected physical motions.
- Verify safe shutdown on obstacle detection.

## Steps
1. Connect all hardware components according to schematics.
2. Run unit tests to check each subsystem.
3. Perform full system integration test with perception and command modules.
4. Log all data and analyze for anomalies.
5. Stress test on longer runtime.

## Tools
- Serial monitor and logging tools
- Motor controller test jig
- Ultrasonic sensor calibration kit
